# Python Fundamentals Relearning and Remastering

Welcome to my FreeCodeCamp project where I have been relearning and remastering Python fundamentals. This repository contains all the code I've written as part of this learning journey.

## Introduction
I embarked on this journey to solidify my understanding of Python fundamentals and enhance my programming skills. The code in this repository represents various exercises, projects, and challenges encountered during my FreeCodeCamp Python course.

## Topics Covered
The code covers a wide range of Python fundamentals, including but not limited to:
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions and Modules
- Lists, Sets, and Dictionaries
- File Handling
- Exception Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
